# PathBuilder
An application made for my FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics Competition team, written in C# using the .NET framework. 
## Features
<b>1.</b> Allows the user to simulate the trajectory taken by the robot during the autonomous period and generate the corresponding code to be used by the robot in normal orientation or mirrored (reversed) one.<br><br>
<b>2.</b> The user can also:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>a.</b> Set the robot's dimensions and starting position<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>b.</b> Save and load paths.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>c.</b> Change the coordinates of any point in the current path.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>d.</b> Remove points and add them manually by insertion or by interacting with the field image.
